I have a budget tracker project that is already working.  
I want to upgrade and improve it with the following detailed changes:  

---

### 1. Remove unnecessary options
- In the **Settings page**, remove the "About" option completely.  
- Also remove any mention of "Fully Offline" because I plan to run ads, and showing this will make users turn off the internet.

---

### 2. Category grouping and totals
- Currently, when I add multiple transactions under the same category (for example, "Shopping"), they all save as separate entries.  
- Keep these **individual entries visible** (with date and amount), but also **calculate and display the total for that category**.  

**Example:**  
- Entry 1: Shopping â†’ â‚¹250 (20/08/2025)  
- Entry 2: Shopping â†’ â‚¹150 (20/08/2025)  

Both entries should still be visible individually, but above/below them show:  
ðŸ‘‰ "Total Shopping: â‚¹400"  

- This should work for **every category** (Food, Bills, Travel, etc.).  

---

### 3. Filters
- In the filters section, when I click a category (e.g., Shopping), I should only see:  
  - All entries related to Shopping (with date + amount).  
  - At the bottom/top of this filtered list, show the **total spent on Shopping**.  
- Apply the same logic for Food, Bills, Travel, and any other categories.  

---

### 4. PDF Export improvements
- Currently, the PDF export only shows:  
  - Total Income  
  - Total Expenses  
  - Balance  

- I need the PDF export to also include a **clear breakdown of each category**:  
  - Category name  
  - Each entry (date + amount)  
  - Total for that category  

**Example (in PDF):**  

Shopping  
- 20/08/2025 â†’ â‚¹250  
- 20/08/2025 â†’ â‚¹150  
Total Shopping: â‚¹400  

Food  
- 21/08/2025 â†’ â‚¹200  
Total Food: â‚¹200  

At the bottom of the PDF, still show:  
ðŸ‘‰ Total Income, Total Expenses, Balance.  

---

### 5. Responsive design
- Make the project fully **mobile-friendly**.  
- On small screens, show transactions in a **single column layout** for better readability.  
- Adjust fonts, spacing, and buttons so that it looks clean on both desktop and mobile.  
- The floating action button (for adding a new transaction) should not overlap with content on smaller screens.  

---

### 6. Keep existing functionality
- Do **not break any current features**.  
- Existing add/edit/delete transaction features should continue to work.  
- The database/storage logic should remain the same, only extend it for totals and category grouping.  

---

### 7. (Optional but recommended improvements)
- Add a **category summary page or chart** (Pie Chart or Bar Chart) to quickly visualize how much money was spent in each category this month.  
- Allow export to **CSV/Excel** in addition to PDF.  
- Add a **monthly view**: users can pick a month and see totals for each category in that month.  

---

Please implement these improvements carefully.  
Do not remove any existing code or break the appâ€™s flow.  
Just extend it with these new features and design improvements.
